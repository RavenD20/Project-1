There was not valid information given with the instructions and it really seems like it was a test to see how far you will go until you give up.
I figured out how to create this repository on accident and was discouraging but i feel if you dont give up and keep working you can make it
all work.
I didnt manage to complete of fix everything though some of it was pretty confusing. But Im quite sure I will catch on fast once its explained.
